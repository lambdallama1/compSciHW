    "\n",
    "Another example of a problem that can't be solved analytically but can be solved via computation is a pendulem when angles are larger.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is particularly interesting because a pendulem in simple harmonic motion, is one of the principle examples of problems given in a first year physics class. \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is difficult because the set up leads to the differential equation: \n",
    "$\\frac{d^2}{dt^2} \\theta = -\\frac{g}{L} sin(\\theta)$\n",
    "\n",
    "For small angles, this can be approximated as $\\frac{d^2}{dt^2} \\theta = -\\frac{g}{L}\\theta$, the equation of a SHO, the general case is much harder. The solution of which involves the Jacobian elliptic function for which values must be found via computation. \n",

Both the function 'f' and the program as a whole check if the number is positive, so the first 'if' statement inside 'f' is never used. Not sure where to put this, but the function 'f' is also more complicated than it needs to be. A better method would be to use recursion, as shown in my code below</li>\n",
